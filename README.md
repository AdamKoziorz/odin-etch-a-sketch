# odin-etch-a-sketch

I am completing various small projects as part of the Odin Project. "Etch-a-Sketch" is the fourth project in the Foundations course, which further tests DOM manipulation to create something "between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch".

Additional features such as erasing and clearing, as well as "drag to draw" has been implemented.
